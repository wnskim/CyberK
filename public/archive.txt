<h3>Chihiro Tea | 94 Willoughby Street</h3>
Today, as I walked the streets of Brooklyn, I came across a cafe selling a drink called 少女の恋(young girl’s love). 
Mildly interested, I gave the drink a try.
<br><br>
With the first sip, sakura petals danced through the air, swirling around me like a soft breeze in spring; My heart began fluttering, like in the fleeting moments of first love. 
<br><br>
With each new sip, I felt the sweet kiss of a young girl’s lips on mine: soft and supple, lips glistening with a rose-tinted lip gloss. 
<br><br>
The flavors bloomed like the chapters of a shoujo manga, each more delicate and lovely than the last. First came the strawberry: playful and sweet, like a secret shared between best friends. Then, a hint of lemon: bright and refreshing, like a cool zephyr on a hot summer day. And finally, the rose: romantic, lingering, and slightly melancholic, as if to gently remind me that even the most tender love stories carry a trace of bittersweetness.
<br><br>
If first love could be captured in a cup, this is what it would taste like...

I'm genuinely in awe at how a girl can both have such a skinny waist and such fat tits at the same time. I'm not even a woman and I'm upset I don't have a figure like this... <br><br>
Some people compare women being sexualized with how men get depicted with 50 lb of muscle, but at least muscle mass is something you can change about yourself... When I see Barret Wallace or Goku or John Cena, honestly, that only motivates me to work harder so I can be like them.
