<div class="diaryHead"><span id="diary_5">Regret and Doubt | Dec. 5, 2024 (Thu) 04:58 | Post No. 5</p></div>
I attended one of the best high schools in my area. It was a selective high school which specialized in computer science. I met people there who would become some of my best friends, I experienced teen love (multiple times), and I graduated with good grades and went on to attend the best university in New York state. I loved my high school. I would regularly volunteer to give orientations of the school to prospective students, I was active in student government, and was generally very promotive of the school. However, one and a half years later, I now regret having attended this high school. <br><br>

To be clear, this is not an attack on my highschool. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. This is moreso a reflection, perhaps a rambling, as I experience regret and doubt.<br>
At my high school, despite it being ranked one of the best high schools in the state, the humanities department was basically non-existent. We took the history and english classes required by the state, but even those could barely be considered high school level classes in my opinion. In our Modern American Literature class, we read a total of one and a half books the entire year; I can’t even remember anything I learned from my Junior year history class because the only work we were given was a worksheet each class that took 5 minutes to complete; In my Early American Literature class, my teacher began the year by saying “I realize the students here are all STEM oriented, so I’m okay if people don’t come out of this class loving the material.” And it seemed the entire school had that attitude about humanities education. While it was standard to have over an hour of homework a day for classes like physics, calculus, or chemistry, anything more than 15 minutes worth of work for a humanities class was considered outrageous. When we read <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, we read at a pace of roughly one chapter every 2-3 classes, and we never had to write any sort of analytical paper. In fact, from my four English/literature classes I took there, I can only recall writing one essay of any kind. There were a few teachers who I respected for their clear knowledge and passion for literature or poetry, but I could tell they were limiting themselves in order to meet the low standard of the students. When we were able to choose electives, there were dozens of STEM classes ranging from advanced programming classes to every AP science. However, on the humanities side, there were a few slack-off history classes, AP lit and AP lang, and Spanish. In this way, the humanities were a complete afterthought. They were lumped together with physical education or dance appreciation: merely taken to fulfill graduation requirements. Unsurprisingly, with one or two exceptions, everyone from my graduating class attended college intending to major in either a STEM subject or econ/business. To be honest, at the time, I did not feel as though my school was lacking in humanities education… or perhaps I did not care about the humanities enough to notice. <br><br>

My first awakening came during my freshman year literature seminar. I was shocked to realize that I was in the minority to have never read Homer in high school. Over the course of two semesters, we read through the major works of literature, starting from Homer and Vergil then ending with Dostoyevsky and Woolfe. In my seminar of roughly twenty students, I think I was one of the only students to have never read a single text on the syllabus. This class was the first time I read Shakespeare! My first semester was a trudge as I struggled to catch up to my classmates. Even now, after a year and a half, I can still feel how behind I am compared to my classmates. I regularly hear comments along the lines of “What I can remember about Rousseau from high school is…”.<br><br>

The big qualm I have about my high school is not that it underprepared me for college (although it is true), but that it did not expose me enough to the humanities. With the majority of my classes being in STEM subjects, I knew for sure that the study I wanted to pursue was computer science. In fact, I had taken 5-7 computer science classes in high school, and so even within the field, I had a general understanding of what sorts of areas within computer science I wanted to pursue.<br><br>

Now, having taken two semesters of literature, one semester of philosophy, one semester of Japanese, and one semester of writing in gender and sexuality, I’ve come to fully appreciate and love the humanities. I love both the analytical and creative sides of it; I love how it allows me to appreciate art and life around me; and to be honest, what I’ve learned in my humanities classes come up way more in daily life than anything I’ve learned in my computer science classes.<br><br>

The problem is, I’m a year and a half into my computer science degree, and don’t know how to pivot from here. I still do enjoy computer science, and the salaries that come with the degree are certainly enticing, but I just don’t know if that would be a fulfilling life. Whereas I thoroughly enjoy and love every second of my humanities classes, I only do the bare minimum to get by in my computer science classes. I barely attend lectures, and start the homeworks the night they are due. I recently watched <a href="https://youtu.be/S1cWUtgQe_Q?si=ThXOkvxu_holDkDg">a YouTube Video</a> made by an MIT-graduate who talks about how he has spent the past twenty years hating himself for becoming a neurosurgeon instead pursuing poetry or philosophy. This video resonated with me in a way that I could only begin to describe. Many aspects of his story and way of thinking align with my own, and it scares me that this video is a portal allowing me to see my future self. <br><br>

Now, the reason I brought up my high school in this dilemma is that I wish I had been able to explore the humanities in the same way I had been able to explore the STEM subjects. I wish I had been able to take proper literature classes or classes in the arts so that I could holistically evaluate my options and would now be less undecided on my future. Even now, I say I want to pursue the humanities, but I have no idea what I would want to pursue within the humanities. For next semester, I’ve registered for a drawing class, an east asian literature class, and a philosophy class. The problem is, I haven’t had enough exposure to the humanities to even know what I want to do. Even beyond these classes, I have interests in film, in genders/sexuality studies, in anthropology, I’ve recently gotten into politics… Freshman year was the time to take all of these classes and figure out what I wanted to do, but because I jumped straight into the computer science degree, I can’t sufficiently explore these fields and graduate in 4 years.<br><br>

Perhaps this is a case of the grass being greener on the other side… perhaps if I were to pursue a career in the humanities I would tell myself in 20 years, “I should’ve just gotten a degree that gets me a high paying job and I could pursue my other interests in my free time.” Or maybe there is still a way to pursue both the humanities and computer science… I can become a writer like Douglass Rushkoff or a game developer… Maybe I can just get an MFA after college or go to law school… <br><br>

I feel a bit lost right now… This is the first time in my life where I’m so unsure of what to do… I just don’t want to live a life I’d regret.

This past week, I had a girl confess her love for me. <br><br>

I’ve known this girl, Ellie, for a while now, since we share many friends, but we only recently started to get close. We went out on a couple of museum outings as friends as well as some larger group outings, and then about half a week ago, she confessed her feelings for me... I don’t reciprocate those feelings.<br><br>

I don’t think that I was being particularly flirty with her or intentionally leading her on. There were times when I’d notice her leg was touching mine and I didn’t move away, but we were seated at crowded tables or on the subway... I feel kind of bad for friend-zoning her, but I suppose it is better than leading her on.<br><br><br><br>

On a somewhat similar note, I find it so frustrating how hard it is to just become friends with someone without already having a shared connection of a mutual friend or a class or a club. There are these two girls (they are roommates) that live on my floor who I want to become friends with. One seems super introverted. The other, I’ve interacted with a bit more (albeit briefly and sparsely) but I think they are so cool. They seem like they would share a lot of interests as me (I’ve seen one of them post about Hatsune Miku and AO3 on social media) and I always see one of them post cool music like Utada Hikaru.<br><br>

I feel like if they were guys, it would be so easy to just ask them “Wanna go get something to eat?” or “Wanna play poker with us?” but with them, I’m not sure how to approach them to become friends... <br><br>

A while ago, I had some pocky so I shared it with them... I don’t know why but I was too scared? socially anxious? nervous? to just knock on their door so I left it by their door with a note so i wouldn’t have to directly interact with them.<br>
But as a thank you, one of the girls made some mango pomelo sago and shared it with me... She sms’ed me and told me to knock on their door, and when I did, she seemed to be in kind of a panic and the conversation was cut super short to just the “here’s the drink” “thank you”... Maybe we were just both too socially inept? I have no idea what to make of it...<br>
But maybe it wouldn’t be too weird to invite them out to go eat lunch or dinner or something else casual... <br><br>

Anyways, my social anxiety has gotten worse (or perhaps just more noticeable). I noticed that whenever I participate in my philosophy class, my hands shake and I have to sit on them. And this comes after rehearsing what I am going to say for 5-10 minutes in my head. Maybe it’s because I’m starting to take the class seriously... I’m not sure... But this comes at a crossroads when I feel like I’ve finally gotten close enough with my housemates that I feel comfortable showing my true self. <br><br><br><br>

This post has been very rambly and jumpy from topic to topic but I want to try writing a bit more openly. These posts have been a bit performative from the beginning (which I suppose is inevitable with the nature of a blog) but I wanted to try being more open and honest and post more frequently. I think in a few years it would be nice to look back and see my true headspace.

Rejoice! As the light of my encephalon has been bestowed upon thee, the darkness in thou souls may be extinguished.<br><br>
My first post on this new (and debatably improved) version of this website... <br>
I was originally building a professional portfolio, but I got sidetracked and eventually found myself just building another personal blog...<br>
This new design is hopefully going to be a bit more reflective of the nature of my postings. With the old site, I found that the more “serious” postings were a bit undermined by certain aspects of the design of the website (like the perpetually dancing Hatsune Miku on every page). My old “persona” hasn’t died, but I feel that this new layout will establish a bit more of a neutral tone for my postings.<br><br>
I’m also trying to be a bit more “tech-y” with this new website... I’ve started using GitHub, I’ve incorporated a decent amount of JavaScript, and have created an RSS feed so people can be notified of new postings... (although, I’m still getting used to RSS feeds, so expect it to be a bit wonky until I figure it out). <br><br>
I also felt that reviving my digital journal would be greatly beneficial in my own journey of forming consciousness and critical thinking... I want to form stronger beliefs and become more educated on the world around me, and I’m sure I’ll enjoy looking back at how my thoughts developed... Perhaps in a century, this blog will be studied as has the journals of Kafka or Woolfe or Kerouac... <br>HAHA how pretentious... <br><br>
Anyways... If you guys have any suggestions for this site, please let me know.
