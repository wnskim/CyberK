I'm genuinely in awe at how a girl can both have such a skinny waist and such fat tits at the same time. I'm not even a woman and I'm upset I don't have a figure like this… <br><br>
Some people compare women being sexualized with how men are always depicted with 50 lb of muscle, but at least muscle mass is something you can change about yourself... When I see Barret Wallace or Goku or John Cena, honestly, that only motivates me to work harder so I can be like them.

Rejoice! As the light of my encephalon has been bestowed upon thee, the darkness in thou souls may be extinguished.<br><br>
My first post on this new (and debatably improved) version of this website… <br>
I was originally building a professional portfolio, but I got sidetracked and eventually found myself just building another personal blog…<br>
This new design is hopefully going to be a bit more reflective of the nature of my postings. With the old site, I found that the more “serious” postings were a bit undermined by certain aspects of the design of the website (like the perpetually dancing Hatsune Miku on every page). My old “persona” hasn’t died, but I feel that this new layout will establish a bit more of a neutral tone for my postings.<br><br>
I’m also trying to be a bit more “tech-y” with this new website… I’ve started using GitHub, I’ve incorporated a decent amount of JavaScript, and have created an RSS feed so people can be notified of new postings… (although, I’m still getting used to RSS feeds, so expect it to be a bit wonky until I figure it out). <br><br>
I also felt that reviving my digital journal would be greatly beneficial in my own journey of forming consciousness and critical thinking… I want to form stronger beliefs and become more educated on the world around me, and I’m sure I’ll enjoy looking back at how my thoughts developed… Perhaps in a century, this blog will be studied as has the journals of Kafka or Woolfe or Kerouac… <br>HAHA how pretentious… <br><br>
Anyways… If you guys have any suggestions for this site, please let me know.
