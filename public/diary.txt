This past week, I had a girl confess her love for me. <br><br>

I’ve known this girl, Ellie, for a while now, since we share many friends, but we only recently started to get close. We went out on a couple of museum outings as friends as well as some larger group outings, and then about half a week ago, she confessed her feelings for me… I don’t reciprocate those feelings.<br><br>

I don’t think that I was being particularly flirty with her or intentionally leading her on. There were times when I’d notice her leg was touching mine and I didn’t move away, but we were seated at crowded tables or on the subway… I feel kind of bad for friend-zoning her, but I suppose it is better than leading her on.<br><br><br><br>



On a somewhat similar note, I find it so frustrating how hard it is to just become friends with someone without already having a shared connection of a mutual friend or a class or a club. There are these two girls (they are roommates) that live on my floor who I want to become friends with. One seems super introverted. The other, I’ve interacted with a bit more (albeit briefly and sparsely) but I think they are so cool. They seem like they would share a lot of interests as me (I’ve seen one of them post about Hatsune Miku and AO3 on social media) and I always see one of them post cool music like Utada Hikaru.<br><br>

I feel like if they were guys, it would be so easy to just ask them “Wanna go get something to eat?” or “Wanna play poker with us?” but with them, I’m not sure how to approach them to become friends… <br><br>

A while ago, I had some pocky so I shared it with them… I don’t know why but I was too scared? socially anxious? nervous? to just knock on their door so I left it by their door with a note so i wouldn’t have to directly interact with them.<br>
But as a thank you, one of the girls made some mango pomelo sago and shared it with me… She sms’ed me and told me to knock on their door, and when I did, she seemed to be in kind of a panic and the conversation was cut super short to just the “here’s the drink” “thank you”... Maybe we were just both too socially inept? I have no idea what to make of it…<br>
But maybe it wouldn’t be too weird to invite them out to go eat lunch or dinner or something else casual… <br><br>

Anyways, my social anxiety has gotten worse (or perhaps just more noticeable). I noticed that whenever I participate in my philosophy class, my hands shake and I have to sit on them. And this comes after rehearsing what I am going to say for 5-10 minutes in my head. Maybe it’s because I’m starting to take the class seriously… I’m not sure… But this comes at a crossroads when I feel like I’ve finally gotten close enough with my housemates that I feel comfortable showing my true self. <br><br><br><br>



This post has been very rambly and jumpy from topic to topic but I want to try writing a bit more openly. These posts have been a bit performative from the beginning (which I suppose is inevitable with the nature of a blog) but I wanted to try being more open and honest and post more frequently. I think in a few years it would be nice to look back and see my true headspace.

<h3>Chihiro Tea | 94 Willoughby Street</h3>
Today, as I walked the streets of Brooklyn, I came across a cafe selling a drink called 少女の恋(young girl’s love). 
Mildly interested, I gave the drink a try.
<br><br>
With the first sip, sakura petals danced through the air, swirling around me like a soft breeze in spring; My heart began fluttering, like in the fleeting moments of first love. 
<br><br>
With each new sip, I felt the sweet kiss of a young girl’s lips on mine: soft and supple, lips glistening with a rose-tinted lip gloss. 
<br><br>
The flavors bloomed like the chapters of a shoujo manga, each more delicate and lovely than the last. First came the strawberry: playful and sweet, like a secret shared between best friends. Then, a hint of lemon: bright and refreshing, like a cool zephyr on a hot summer day. And finally, the rose: romantic, lingering, and slightly melancholic, as if to gently remind me that even the most tender love stories carry a trace of bittersweetness.
<br><br>
If first love could be captured in a cup, this is what it would taste like…

I'm genuinely in awe at how a girl can both have such a skinny waist and such fat tits at the same time. I'm not even a woman and I'm upset I don't have a figure like this… <br><br>
Some people compare women being sexualized with how men get depicted with 50 lb of muscle, but at least muscle mass is something you can change about yourself... When I see Barret Wallace or Goku or John Cena, honestly, that only motivates me to work harder so I can be like them.

Rejoice! As the light of my encephalon has been bestowed upon thee, the darkness in thou souls may be extinguished.<br><br>
My first post on this new (and debatably improved) version of this website… <br>
I was originally building a professional portfolio, but I got sidetracked and eventually found myself just building another personal blog…<br>
This new design is hopefully going to be a bit more reflective of the nature of my postings. With the old site, I found that the more “serious” postings were a bit undermined by certain aspects of the design of the website (like the perpetually dancing Hatsune Miku on every page). My old “persona” hasn’t died, but I feel that this new layout will establish a bit more of a neutral tone for my postings.<br><br>
I’m also trying to be a bit more “tech-y” with this new website… I’ve started using GitHub, I’ve incorporated a decent amount of JavaScript, and have created an RSS feed so people can be notified of new postings… (although, I’m still getting used to RSS feeds, so expect it to be a bit wonky until I figure it out). <br><br>
I also felt that reviving my digital journal would be greatly beneficial in my own journey of forming consciousness and critical thinking… I want to form stronger beliefs and become more educated on the world around me, and I’m sure I’ll enjoy looking back at how my thoughts developed… Perhaps in a century, this blog will be studied as has the journals of Kafka or Woolfe or Kerouac… <br>HAHA how pretentious… <br><br>
Anyways… If you guys have any suggestions for this site, please let me know.
